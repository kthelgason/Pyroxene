Pyroxene
========

Pyroxene is a light-weight HTTP proxy server written in python.
The name is also that of a group of inosilicate minerals commonly present in volcanic lava. This reflects the projects
roots. It's also considered appropriate due to the fact that it begins with "Py", a common pattern for projects in
the python community.
